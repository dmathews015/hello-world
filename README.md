Lab 01-Versioning Your Work
My name is David Mathews and I am a transfer student from Collin College in Plano, Texas. I live about an hour north of Dallas in a small town named Van Alstyne and will be doing my degree all online. I work in Downtown Dallas in construction administation for an architect firm and am looking forward to pursuing my degree and then a career in cyber security.
